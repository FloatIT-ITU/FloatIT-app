# Privacy Policy - FloatIT

**Effective date:** 17 September 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how FloatIT ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses and discloses personal data when you use the FloatIT app and related services. FloatIT is run by students at the IT University of Copenhagen. This policy is written to be GDPR‑compatible.

## 1. Data controller

FloatIT (student group) - IT University of Copenhagen

For requests about personal data, please open an issue in the FloatIT GitHub repository or contact the team via the FloatIT Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/floatit.itucph/

## 2. Personal data we collect

- Account information (primary email address provided via Microsoft/Firebase authentication).
- Public profile data: display name, occupation, icon color (if provided by you).
- Event-related data: events you create, join, or attend; waiting list status.
- Usage data: basic analytics about app usage (minimal and anonymized), and push notification tokens if you opt in.

We do not collect payment information or health data.

## 3. Legal basis for processing

- Authentication and account management: necessary to provide the service and fulfil the user contract.
- Profile and event management: performance of a service you requested (managing events you join/create).
- Legal compliance and security: to prevent abuse and protect accounts.

## 4. How we use and share data

- We use data to operate the app (authenticate users, create and manage events, notify participants).
- We do not sell personal data to third parties.
- We may share limited data with service providers (Firebase/Google) as data processors; their use is governed by their privacy policies and our configuration.
- Admins may view user data only to operate and moderate the service.

## 5. Data storage and transfers

- Data is stored in Firebase (Firestore) under the FloatIT project. Where possible we rely on EU region settings for Firebase.
- If a processor stores data outside the EU, data transfer safeguards (standard contractual clauses) apply - see the Firebase/Google documentation for details.

## 6. Data retention and deletion

- Your account and associated data are retained while your account exists.
- You can delete your account from within the app (Settings → Delete Account). Deletion removes your data from our production Firestore database; backups may persist for a short period depending on Google retention policies.

## 7. Your rights

Under GDPR you have rights including access, rectification, deletion, restriction of processing and portability. To exercise these rights, create an issue in `FloatIT-app` or contact us via the FloatIT Facebook Group. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

## 8. Security

- We use Firebase security rules to protect access to Firestore data.
- Access to admin functionality requires documented admin accounts and protections.

## 9. Cookies and tracking

- The app uses cookies / local storage only as necessary for authentication and session management in the web client.
- We do not use advertising trackers or third‑party analytics beyond minimal, privacy‑minded telemetry.

## 10. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy over time. Significant changes will be posted in the app and in this document with an updated effective date.

## 11. Contact

If you have questions about this policy or want to exercise your rights, please open an issue in the `FloatIT-app` repository or use our Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/floatit.itucph/
